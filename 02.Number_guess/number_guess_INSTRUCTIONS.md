# Description to small project: "number_guess"
https://github.com/ivoivanov0830006/1.0.Python_PROJECTS/blob/main/number_guess
   
# At first the user need to settle a range. First IMPUT is the max number the program will choose number which the user will try to guess / find. 

# Than we have some conditions that have to be met ( no negative numbers and to type only numbers )

# We also have the ability to see when we will guess the number with GUESS_COUNT - whether will it be on the first / second / tenth atempt 

# The program will help the user with guidence if the current number is ABOVE or BELOW the searched one. It will be easier and faster for guessing that way, instead of just blind picking next number.
